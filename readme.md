# BAYMAG

The BAYMAG package is a set of Bayesian hierarchical models for Mg/Ca in planktic foraminifera. The functions here can be used to both predict Mg/Ca from T, S, pH, Omega, and cleaning method, and predict T given constraints on the other four predictor variables. For a full discussion of this model, please read the source publication:

Jessica E. Tierney, Steven B. Malevich, William Gray, Lael Vetter, and Kaustubh Thirumalai (2019), Bayesian calibration of the Mg/Ca paleothermometer in planktic foraminifera. Paleoceanography & Paleoclimatology 34, 2005--2030, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019PA003744.

**2023 update:** There are now two options for correcting Mg/Ca data for changing Mg/Ca of seawater. **Option 1** will use the original published seawater curve in Tierney et al. 2019. **Option 2** uses an updated curve incorporating the Na/Ca-based estimates of [Rosenthal et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022PA004413). Na/Ca is a proxy for the Ca concentration of seawater. Following Rosenthal et al. we use the halite fluid inclusion Mg estimates of [Brennan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.2475/08.2013.01) and combine those with the Na/Ca-based Ca estimates to produce Mg/Ca estimates. We also omit the coral-based Mg/Ca estimates of [Gothmann et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2015.03.018) from the last 20 Ma due to their high scatter. Use of **Option 2** will result in higher temperature estimates for Pliocene and Miocene data than **Option 1** and will predict lower Mg/Ca for these time intervals when used in the forward-modeling mode.

A quick guide to basic use:

To model Mg/Ca from T, S, pH, Omega, and cleaning values:
Use baymag_forward.m or baymag_forward_ln.m (which calculates ln(Mg/Ca)). These functions calculate Mg/Ca values using posterior draws from the calibration model (stored in the params.mat files). It has the option to add a normal prior if you would like to place some restrictions on posterior Mg/Ca, and an option to account for changing Mg/Ca of seawater (for longer geological timescales). baymag_forward and baymag_forward_ln have no dependent functions but do need the params.mat files.

To model SST from Mg/Ca, S, pH, Omega, and cleaning values:
Use baymag_predict.m. This function calculates SST given Mg/Ca and inputs of S, pH, Omega, and cleaning through Bayesian inference. It has an option to correct for Mg/Ca of seawater changes. The Bayesian models are written in Stan (mgpred.stan and mgpred_sw.stan). You will need to install both Stan and MatlabStan in order to use this function. Download the latest version of the command line version of Stan here: https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases. BAYMAG has been tested up to v2.33.1. MatlabStan is here: https://github.com/brian-lau/MatlabStan/releases. BAYMAG has been tested with the last released version, v2.15.1.0. NOTE: if you try and run MatlabStan and get the error "Having a problem getting stan version", open up StanModel.m and comment out Line 196: ver = self.stan_version(). Add a new line below: ver = '2.30.1'; (or replace with the current version of cmdstan).

Alternatively, you can run the Stan models from Python or R, but in that case you will need to write your own wrapper like baymag_predict.

To model SST from Mg/Ca, S, pH, Omega, and cleaning values and include errors in S, pH, and Omega:
Use baymag_predict_err.m. This version allows the user to input priors for T, S, pH, and Omega and therefore include uncertainties in S, pH, and Omega. It iteratively solves for posteriors for all four variables, thus be advised that it is quite a bit slower than baymag_predict.m. It also has an option for a seawater correction.

In addition to Stan, baymag_predict requires the params.mat files and the dependent functions ChainConvergence.m and EarthChordDistances_2.m. ChainConvergence is used to calculate the Rhat and Neff statistics (c.f. Gelman et al., "Bayesian Data Analysis") to assess convergence.

The omegaph and tsget folders contain the accessory functions omgph.m, get_sea.m, and get_ann.m. These can be used to grab modern values of omega, pH, temperature, and salinity for any location. They require EarthChordDistances_2.m to calculate the nearest gridded location based on chordal distance, and the netcdfs and .mat files in the folders which contain GLODAPv2 and WOA13 data.
